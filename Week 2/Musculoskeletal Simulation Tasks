Task 1:

The issues with the hip felxion angles is that there are no constarints on the angle through which the hip moves. 
This is unrealistic as most poeple cannot move thier hip through such a great angle.

Task 2:

The graph (Fiber length vs Knee angle) compares the rectus femoris and vastus intermedius at a hip felxion of 0 
and 45 degrees. The green curve shows the hip flexion at 0 degrees and the red curve for 45 degrees. The difference 
between these plots is that the curve at 0 degrees is higher for the rectus femoris than at 45 degrees. 
Whereas, the curve for the vastus intermedius is the same for 0 and 45 degrees
