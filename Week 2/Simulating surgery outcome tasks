Task 1:

To figure out which muscles/muscle groups are responsible for changes in angles of the wrist flexion and deviation
I plotted a graph of all the muscles in the wrist. I used fibre length for the y-axis and for the x-axis I alternated 
between the different operations. These graphs would give me curves whereby I could distinguish between which muscles 
were in control of changing angles and which were not because muscles not involved would not have a change in fibre 
length, the curve would be a straight line.

I found that all the muscles and muscle groups are responsible for deviation and flexion.

Task 2:

I will not be a very good virtual biomechanic as my surgery was not succesful. The curve for the flexion moment vs 
flexion has roughly the same shape but is highr on the y-axis. The curve for the deviation moment vs deviation 
has a differnt shape whereby the end of the curve is more curved compared with the in-buil surgery which is completly 
straight, also my curve is higher on the y-axis. This shows that I will destory wrists rather then help them.
